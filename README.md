# 🏏IPL Data Analysis (EDA + Power BI Dashboard)
## 📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IPL matches and deliveries datasets to uncover meaningful insights related to team performance, player trends, and match strategies.

This analysis helps understand how different factors such as toss decisions, batting order, overs, and venues influence match outcomes.

## 📂 Dataset Description

Source: Kaggle (IPL Dataset)

Files Used:

matches.csv – match-level information

deliveries.csv – ball-by-ball data


## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

**pandas** – data manipulation

**numpy** – numerical operations

**matplotlib & seaborn** – data visualization

**Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and visualization

**Power BI** – interactive dashboard creation




## 🔍 Analysis Performed
**1️⃣ Team Performance Insights**

- Team-wise win distribution across seasons

- Batting first vs chasing success analysis

- Impact of toss decision on match outcomes

- Home vs away performance comparison

**2️⃣ Player Performance Trends**

- Top run scorers across seasons

- Top wicket takers across seasons

- Strike rate and consistency analysis

- Player of the Match (POTM) trend analysis

**3️⃣ Batting Strategy Analysis**

- Runs scored by batting position (Openers vs Middle Order)

- Over-wise run patterns:

- Powerplay (1–6)

- Middle Overs (7–15)

- Death Overs (16–20)

- Analysis of high-scoring matches

- Successful run chase patterns

**4️⃣ Bowling Strategy Analysis**

- Wicket distribution by overs

- Types of dismissals analysis

- Economy rate trends in different phases

- Bowler performance comparison across:

- Venues
